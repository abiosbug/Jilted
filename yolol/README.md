# YOLOL
There's a lot of YOLOL involved (+50 chips), and one of the main bottlenecks is the processing speed.
If you need speed, you want your code to run on a single line on an individual chip.  Most operations can be done on the Basic YOLOL chip, but for repurposing purposes, I'm only using Advanced chips.

I've grouped the YOLOL sections per logical feature and color coded them.  I try to keep everything together inside the designated racks: both the script checking for a switch or button, as well as the actual script and possible memory chips.

## Memory Relays
Memory Relays can be used in the same network to rename variables.  This allows for YOLOL-free display label adjustments as well as concise yolol FCU manipulations without having custom keybinds.  You'll need 2 memory chips as well and place them in the relay slots.  Wire both cable connections to the network as well.  Note the arrows indicating which chip will pass on its value to the other chip as the relays work in a single direction.  The fields are mapped in order, so 1st field of the input chip maps to the 1st field on the output chip.

Example Propellant calculation: instead of having yolol sum up and set the total stored propellant to eg `:Propellant`, you can use the Memory Relay to map `:GasNetworkStoredResource` to `:Propellant`.  
Example FCU manipulation: you want `:roll=100` in YOLOL to roll right and `:FCURotationalRoll` is just too long to fit on your line, you map `:roll` to `:FCURotationalRoll` and be done with it!

## Global variables
A lot of advanced scripts use global variables to share values between different chips.  Basic scripts use them too to listen for buttons or enable devices.  
üêõ There is no memory locking in YOLOL so you can easily overwrite existing variables, causing unintented behaviour (naming clashes), aka bugs.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Using global variables in YOLOL that don't exist, causes the line to be silently ignored.  _ISAN for example takes advantage of this to detect a quad or mono setup._  
There are 2 ways to create a global variable:
1. assign it to a TextPanel, Button, Switch or Device instance
2. add it to a memory chip
